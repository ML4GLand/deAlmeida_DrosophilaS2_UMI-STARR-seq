Compiled code that runs different iterations of each pipeline should go here. Different pipelines are up to the coder's discretion, but could be things like
- The basic version fo the pipeline on one sample (`single_sample_pipeline`)
- A multisample version of the pipeline
- Running the pipeline on an HPC (e.g. SLURM)
- Running the pipeline with the Python versi on of a tool (e.g. WGCNA)
